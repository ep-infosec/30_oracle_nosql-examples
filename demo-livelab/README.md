**Oracle NoSQL Database** is designed for today’s most demanding applications that 
require low latency responses, flexible data models, and elastic scaling for dynamic workloads. 
It supports JSON, Table and Key-Value datatypes running on-premise, or as a cloud 
service with on-demand throughput and storage based provisioning.

**Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service** is now a fully managed database service running 
on Gen 2 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure hardware.

Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service makes it easy for developers to build applications, 
delivering predictable single digit millisecond response times with data replication for high availability. 
The service offers ACID transactions, serverless scaling, comprehensive security, and low pay-per-use pricing 
for both on-demand and provisioned capacity modes, including 100% compatibility with on-premises Oracle NoSQL Database.
