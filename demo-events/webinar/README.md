## About this Workshop

Modern applications benefit from predictable low latency, flexibility, and horizontal scale-out of NoSQL databases. 
Join us to learn how effortless it is to develop a modern application using Oracle NoSQL Database. 
This lab is based on data from an airline baggage tracking application. 
This lab walks you through the steps to create tables in Oracle NoSQL Database, load data into the database, and perform basic queries.  
Estimated Time: 50 Minutes

## About this Workshop

Modern applications benefit from predictable low latency, flexibility, and horizontal scale-out of NoSQL databases. 
Join us to learn how effortless it is to develop a modern application using Oracle NoSQL Database. 

In this Workshop, we show how to write and optimize queries over data that contain nested arrays. We do so via a set of example queries and indexes over a table 
that models the users of an TV streaming service.

In addition to presenting these examples in SQL, a java application program is also provided that creates the “users” table, populates it with some sample rows, 
creates some indexes and executes the queries displaying their results.

Estimated Time: 50 Minutes
